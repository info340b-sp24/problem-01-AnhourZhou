A half-Japanese student who transferred to Okinawa from Canada, with his mother, and ended up transferring into 
Reki's (His friend) class. Growing up as a snowboarder, Langa quickly learns to transfer his skills into

        <li>His high level of snowboarding and skateboarding impresses me and becomes the role model I want to learn from</li>
